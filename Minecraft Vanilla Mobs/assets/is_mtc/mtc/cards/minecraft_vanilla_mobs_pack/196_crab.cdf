Description=The Crab was a proposed mob in the Minecraft Live 2023 Mob Vote alongside the Armadillo and Penguin. It would spawn in mangrove swamps and could lose a large arm dropping a crab claw for placing blocks from a distance. Crabs could be bred with kelp and occasionally waved at players and other crabs.
