Description=An Enderman is a tall neutral mob found in all three dimensions. It becomes hostile if attacked or looked at directly using its arms to attack. Endermen teleport unpredictably and avoid most projectiles. They are harmed by water but do not take damage or teleport while in cauldrons. They occasionally move certain blocks.
