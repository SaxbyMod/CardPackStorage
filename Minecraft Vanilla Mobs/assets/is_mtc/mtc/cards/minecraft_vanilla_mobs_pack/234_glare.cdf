Description=The glare was a proposed mob featured in the Mob Vote during Minecraft Live 2021 alongside the allay and copper golem. It would have flown to areas dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn in and then would have become grumpy to alert the player of this. It may have helped light up these areas as well.
